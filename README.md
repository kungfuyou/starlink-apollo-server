# Apollo tutorial

This app was built and debugged using the [Apollo tutorial](http://apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction.html). ðŸš€

## File structure

The app is split out into two folders:
- `client`: Front End Client runs on :3000
- `server`: GraphQL server runs on :4000

From within the `start` and `final` directories, there are two folders (one for `server` and one for `client`).

## Installation

To run the app, run these commands in two separate terminal windows from the root:

```bash
cd server && npm i && npm start
```

and

```bash
cd client && npm i && npm start
```
